So, this project's aim is to create a videogame light as possible, but with everything is needed to be called a game, a 3D game.
Im not a game programmer and i've never made one, so at first i want to go as minimal as possible, and maybe in future i will learn more complex game engines like Unity or Godot. For the moment i want to combine getting some results faster and a game that i love: Doom.

I discovered that is possible to create custom maps for Doom: the .wad files, since my goal is to create a full game i researched a bit deeper ad i've found that is possible also to use the Doom engine to create full standalone games. 
The first step from now is to learn about the Ultimate Doom Builder map editor and use a .ipk3 package (maps, assets and scripts) to get something out of the cap, then i think i can just make a folder with the engine and my game assets. Idk..
